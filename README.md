# Hey ðŸ‘‹
As you're looking at this, you will be probably having a coding interview with GROPYUS. 
This repo contains some sample projects, in different languages, that serve as a starting point for
our interview. 

Just pick a language (currently java or kotlin) and get familiar with the little codebase if you wish (clone it, run it, so the setup works on your machine in your favourite editor/IDE).
If life is busy right now and you do not manage to do that, don't worry: We reserve some time in the interview to go through this little codebase together before we start working on it.
